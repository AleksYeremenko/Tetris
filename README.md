This project is a complete implementation of the classic **Tetris** game, developed using **Java** and **Swing** for a university assignment. The focus was on applying object-oriented programming principles and mastering GUI development in Java.

## ðŸŽ® Features

- Classic Tetris gameplay with block falling and rotation  
- Real-time rendering using Java Swing  
- Game over detection and score tracking  
- Clean modular structure with multiple classes:
  - `Tetris.java` â€“ main class to launch the game
  - `Board.java` â€“ handles the game board, piece movements, and collisions
  - `Shapes.java` â€“ defines the Tetris pieces and their behaviors
  - `SidePanel.java` â€“ displays additional information (like score or next piece)

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

- Java 17+
- Java Swing (GUI)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
